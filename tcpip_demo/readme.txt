This directory contains a simple chat client and server in C programming language based on BSD sockets. The main purpose of the programs is to demonstrate the reliability part of TCP. The chat server is a relay server which takes messages from one client and relays them to other clients but it also has the ability to drop and randomly corrupt the messages to mimic an unreliable tranport. The client program implements TCP like reliability features (retransmission, in-order packet delivery etc) to show the chat messages correctly to the users regardless of what the server corrupted or dropped.
